                The coffee shop is a cozy and inviting spot with a warm ambiance 
                and a rustic, modern design. Inside, soft lighting and comfortable 
                seating create a relaxed atmosphere perfect for catching up with
                friends, working, or simply unwinding. The aroma of freshly brewed 
                coffee fills the air, with a selection of artisan coffees ranging 
                from rich espressos to creamy lattes and flavorful cold brews. 
                The drink menu also includes herbal teas, refreshing iced beverages,
                 and handcrafted smoothies.

                The snack offerings are just as enticing. You'll find a variety
                 of freshly baked pastries like croissants, muffins, and scones, 
                 along with light bites such as avocado toast, gourmet sandwiches, 
                 and salads. For those with a sweet tooth, there are tempting options 
                 like cookies, cakes, and chocolate treats. The shop’s attention to 
                 quality ingredients and a welcoming vibe makes it a perfect destination
                  whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a leisurely drink..</p>
